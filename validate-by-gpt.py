Identity='Identity. A concept with Identity is one, where the instances can be identified as being the same at any time and in any world, by virtue of this concept. This means that the concept carries an Identity Criterion (IC). It is tagged with +I, and with -I otherwise. It is not important to answer the question of what this IC is (this may be hard to answer), it is sufficient to know that the concept carries an IC.'
