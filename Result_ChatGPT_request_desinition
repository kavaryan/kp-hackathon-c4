Sure, let's assign the relevant OntoClean criteria to each class:

1. Entity:
   - Rigidity: +R (It is based on the notion of essence, and entities are necessarily instances of the concept "Entity" in all worlds and at all times.)
   - Unity: +UC (The concept of "Entity" defines what is part of something and what is not.)
   - Identity: +I (Instances of "Entity" can be identified as being the same at any time and in any world.)

2. Location:
   - Rigidity: +R (Locations are necessarily instances of the concept "Location" in all worlds and at all times.)
   - Unity: +UC (The concept of "Location" defines what is part of a location and what is not.)
   - Identity: -I (Identity is not crucial for locations as they can be identified without a strict identity criterion.)

3. Geographical Region:
   - Rigidity: +R (Geographical regions are necessarily instances of the concept "Geographical Region" in all worlds and at all times.)
   - Unity: +UC (The concept of "Geographical Region" defines what is part of a geographical region and what is not.)
   - Identity: -I (Identity is not crucial for geographical regions as they can be identified without a strict identity criterion.)

4. Amount of Matter:
   - Rigidity: +R (Amounts of matter are necessarily instances of the concept "Amount of Matter" in all worlds and at all times.)
   - Unity: +UC (The concept of "Amount of Matter" defines what is part of an amount of matter and what is not.)
   - Identity: -I (Identity is not crucial for amounts of matter as they can be identified without a strict identity criterion.)

5. Food:
   - Rigidity: +R (Foods are necessarily instances of the concept "Food" in all worlds and at all times.)
   - Unity: +UC (The concept of "Food" defines what is part of a food item and what is not.)
   - Identity: -I (Identity is not crucial for foods as they can be identified without a strict identity criterion.)

So, the relevant OntoClean criteria for each class are as follows:

- Entity: +R, +UC, +I
- Location: +R, +UC, -I
- Geographical Region: +R, +UC, -I
- Amount of Matter: +R, +UC, -I
- Food: +R, +UC, -I
